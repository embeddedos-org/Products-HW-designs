## Physical Testing Required Before Commercial Launch

The following tests require physical hardware and cannot be simulated. They represent the critical path to market.

| Test | Laboratory | Lead Time | Cost |
|------|-----------|----------|------|
| FCC Part 15B radiated emissions | NTS or Element Materials | 8–10 weeks | $8K–$15K |
| FCC §15.253/§15.255 77GHz radar verification | NTS (millimeter-wave lab) | 10–14 weeks | $18K–$35K |
| FCC Part 90 V2X DSRC/C-V2X certification | NTS or Intertek | 10–14 weeks | $15K–$28K |
| FCC §15.247 Wi-Fi 6 / BT integration | Any A2LA lab | 6–8 weeks | $12K–$22K |
| FMVSS 302 flammability | Intertek or SGS | 4–6 weeks | $3K–$6K |
| SAE J2364 driver distraction assessment | Human factors lab | 6–8 weeks | $8K–$15K |
| ISO 26262 ASIL-B independent safety assessment | TÜV Rheinland or SGS | 12–16 weeks | $30K–$60K |
| IEC 62443 SL-2 penetration testing | NCC Group or Rapid7 | 8–10 weeks | $20K–$40K |
| V2X SCMS enrollment | V2X Security Consortium | 6–8 weeks | $5K–$10K |
| SAE J2945/1 BSM conformance | CAMP LLC or USDOT lab | 8–10 weeks | $12K–$20K |

**Total physical testing: ~12 months critical path | $131K–$251K**

## Immediate Next Steps

The three most time-critical actions are:

**1. Contact NTS Laboratories** (ntslabs.com) for FCC testing quote — the 77GHz radar test has a 10–14 week lead time and is the longest single FCC activity. Starting now keeps the 7-month FCC timeline on track.

**2. Engage TÜV Rheinland** (tuv.com/automotive) for ISO 26262 ASIL-B assessment — the 12–16 week lead time for the independent safety assessment is the longest single regulatory activity overall.

**3. Publish legal documents** (Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, EULA) and add FTC disclaimer to all marketing materials before any public announcement or pre-order campaign.
